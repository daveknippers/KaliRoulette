Future to do list
-dynamic odds calculation from spelunker database
-"live" betting mode where the odds are determined by where the bets are placed.  Base odds for a level will still need to be determined by the dynamic odd calculator
-streamlabs api calls to see if someone donated.  If they did give money to that player.  https://twitchalerts.readme.io/docs/donations
-spend golden daves to change skin
	-change damsels
	-change shopkeeper music?

-hard to force ideas
	-force a particular run.
			-we could instantly kill someone if they do a no gold run.
			-instantly agro shopkeepers at start of run
	-force a no agro shopkeeper run (kill player if the shopkeeper is angered)
game braking ideas for the casual pleb.  Need to be damn expensive so it doesnt happen all the time.
-buy items for the player
	-good thing i have the anhk
-give the player gold to buy things in the shop
-pay for a hit on the player to the shopkeeper....at any time
-give kali favor.   Or take it away
