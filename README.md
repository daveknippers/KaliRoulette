# KaliRoulette
By Dave Knippers (dave.knippers [at] gmail dot com) and Justin Miller 

After a year of procrastination, Spelunky Bet / Kali Roulette is available! Now you can bet live in Twitch chat on how I'm going to die. and be rewarded with the bounty of GOLDEN DAVE idols

Everyone starts with 1000 GOLDEN DAVES. If you lose all your GOLDEN DAVES, you'll get 100 GOLDEN DAVES at the start of the next attempt.

Each cause of death has a multiplier on payout on a correct bet. For example, betting 100 GOLDEN DAVES on the shopkeeper will yield 400 GOLDEN DAVES on a correct bet as the shopkeeper has a payout modifier of 4.

# Commands
The bot accepts the following commands:

!bet cause_of_death amount
